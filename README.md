# Rest_Api_Client
A simple Java application that consumes the OpenWeatherMap REST API to fetch and display real-time weather data. It uses Java’s HttpClient to handle HTTP requests and org.json for parsing JSON responses

Description:

For developing the Java project FileOperationsDemo, I used the following tools and technologies:

1] IntelliJ IDEA
The primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write, debug, and run the weather application.
It provided features like syntax highlighting, smart code completion, and integrated terminal, which simplified the process of testing HTTP requests and handling JSON responses.

2] Java Development Kit (JDK)
The JDK was essential for compiling and running the program.
It included the java.net.http.HttpClient package, which was used to make HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, and the core Java libraries needed for networking and exception handling.

3] Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
The JRE executed the compiled bytecode of the program and ensured smooth client-server communication with the REST API.
It allowed the WeatherApp to fetch and display real-time weather data dynamically.

4] Git and GitHub
Git was used for version control, making it easy to track incremental changes in the code and maintain a clean history.
GitHub hosted the repository, enabling backup, collaboration, and showcasing of the project as part of my portfolio.

5] Command Line / Terminal
Though IntelliJ was the main environment, I also used the command line to run the program with javac and java.
This helped test the application outside the IDE and better understand how Java programs interact with external APIs directly.

6] YouTube Videos
YouTube tutorials provided practical guidance on working with REST APIs in Java.
They demonstrated how to use HttpClient, handle responses, and parse JSON data, making it easier to implement real-time weather fetching features.

7] ChatGPT
ChatGPT was an on-demand coding assistant, offering explanations, code snippets, and troubleshooting help when I faced issues.
It guided me through API integration, JSON parsing with org.json, and best practices for writing clean, maintainable code.

8] GeeksforGeeks
GeeksforGeeks was an important reference for understanding Java’s HTTP libraries and JSON parsing techniques.
It provided clear examples of making REST API calls, handling exceptions, and parsing responses into meaningful output for the user.
