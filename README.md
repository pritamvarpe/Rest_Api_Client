Description:

For developing the Java project FileOperationsDemo, I used the following tools and technologies:

1] IntelliJ IDEA

The main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write, debug, and run the Java program.

It provided features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and error detection, which made development smoother.

The inbuilt terminal and project structure management helped in organizing source files properly.

2] Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK was essential for compiling and running the Java program.

It provided the core Java libraries (like java.io and java.nio.file) that were used to perform file handling operations such as creating, reading, writing, and modifying text files.

3] Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The JRE executed the compiled bytecode of the program.

It ensured that the FileOperationsDemo application ran smoothly on the system.

Git and GitHub

Git was used for version control, allowing me to track changes in the project and maintain clean code history.

GitHub was used to host the project repository, making it accessible for collaboration, backup, and showcasing on my profile.

4] Command Line / Terminal

Although IntelliJ handled most of the work, I also used the command line for compiling and running Java files directly with javac and java commands.

This improved my understanding of how the Java compiler and runtime environment work.

Alongside technical tools, I also relied on learning resources that provided explanations, tutorials, and problem-solving guidance during the project:

5] . YouTube Videos

YouTube was an important platform for learning practical aspects of file handling in Java. Watching video tutorials made complex concepts easier to understand, as they combined theoretical explanations with live coding examples. It also helped me debug issues by following step-by-step demonstrations.

6] . ChatGPT

ChatGPT acted as an on-demand assistant throughout the project. Whenever I faced doubts, needed code explanations, or wanted alternative approaches, ChatGPT provided quick and clear solutions. It also helped in generating documentation and improving the project description.

7] . GeeksforGeeks

GeeksforGeeks was one of the most valuable reference sites I used. It offered in-depth articles and coding examples for file handling in Java, including the use of classes like FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter. Its problem-solving tutorials gave me confidence in applying theoretical concepts to real coding tasks.
